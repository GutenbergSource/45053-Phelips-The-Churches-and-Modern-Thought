<HTML><BODY>After putting in the rounds a bunch of religious works, its time for a healthy anti-dose, in the shape of a series of free-thought and rationalist works. For those who like to read Dawkins, Hitchens, Dennet and Harris, this 1911 book will show that many of the arguments against religion have not changed much for over a century.

<p>The text itself will pose little difficulties. Of course, there are loads of footnotes, but those are part of the charm of old books.

<p>Have fun!
